Congratulations! You've successfully created your first Next.js app in the current directory. Now, let's take a quick look at the directory structure:

*   **public/**: Place your static assets (images, fonts, etc.) in this directory.
*   **styles/**: This directory is used for global CSS styles.
*   **components/**: You can create reusable React components in this directory.

Feel free to explore and customize your Next.js app further. You can start by editing the files in the `pages` directory to define your app's routes and functionality.
