# Top 7 Free Unlimited Video Hosting Websites in 2024

Want to share videos online without paying a dime? With these top free unlimited video hosting sites, you can upload and share videos in high quality at no cost.

Unlike paid hosts that limit bandwidth and storage, these free services offer generous limits for video length, resolution, and total space. We’ll compare the top options to help you find the best free video host.

## 1. YouTube

As the world’s largest video platform, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) allows unlimited uploads for free accounts. Videos can be up to 15 minutes long with a max resolution of 1080p. 

YouTube compresses videos to save bandwidth but quality remains excellent. Videos get 1GB of storage each. You’ll also get access to YouTube’s powerful editing tools and analytics.

The catch is videos are public by default. But you can easily change settings to “unlisted” or “private” to control access. Overall, YouTube is ideal for public video sharing.

## 2. Vimeo 

[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), founded in 2004, offers a clean and ad-free platform for video hosting. The free plan gives you 5GB of storage per week to post up to 500 MB weekly.

Video quality is great, with support for 4K resolution. Vimeo’s privacy settings also make it easy to control who can watch your videos.

The main catch is the stricter guidelines on commercial/promotional content compared to YouTube. But for sharing creative videos and content, Vimeo is tough to beat.

## 3. Facebook

Within your profile settings, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) allows unlimited video uploads assuming you have storage left in your 15GB free allotment.

Videos can be up to 240 minutes long and up to 4K resolution. You also get access to basic editing tools and filters to touch up clips right in Facebook.

The biggest advantage to Facebook video is you can easily share videos with friends and family. Privacy controls also let you decide who can view your videos.

## 4. DailyMotion 

[DailyMotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/) positions itself as a YouTube alternative focused more on entertaining videos than social media.

Users get 5GB of free storage. Videos can be up to 60 minutes long at 1080p resolution. DailyMotion compresses clips at upload but retains high visual quality.

Useful analytics are provided on views, shares and more. DailyMotion supports both public and private videos, making it versatile for most video hosting needs.

## 5. Veoh

[Veoh](https://www.veoh.com/) offers 100GB of free video storage, albeit with a cap at 4 hours per video. The service supports clips up to 1080p resolution.

Registering for an account lets you upload longer 10-hour videos at 720p resolution. Veoh utilizes compression but most users report no noticeable loss of quality.

The interface is a bit dated, and some community features aren’t very active anymore. But for sheer storage space, Veoh delivers excellent bang for buck.

## 6. Internet Archive

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is best known for its Wayback Machine. But registered users also get 250GB of free storage for video uploads and other media.

Videos can be up to 5GB each in size and several hours long. There aren’t many fancy features, but everything you upload is stored on secure servers.

Internet Archive supports public, unlisted, and private sharing options. If you value no-strings-attached video archiving, this nonprofit service delivers.

## 7. Yahoo Video 

Lastly, [Yahoo Video](https://video.search.yahoo.com/) shouldn’t be overlooked for video hosting. You get 1TB of free storage, with each video limited to 2GB max size.

Upload is restricted to 720p resolution, however, so it’s better suited for clips rather than full videos. Still, the huge storage allotment makes Yahoo Video worth considering.

Yahoo Video integrates smoothly with other Yahoo services like Flickr for images. The ads are also less intrusive compared to sites like YouTube.

## Choose the Best Free Video Hosting Site for You

While paid hosts offer enhanced feature sets, these free unlimited video hosting services provide ample storage and bandwidth for most users.

Consider how you plan to share your videos. YouTube and Facebook make sharing publicly or with friends a cinch. Sites like Vimeo and DailyMotion focus more on hosting the content itself.

With storage allowances up to 1TB and HD quality support, these top free video hosts make it possible to save and share unlimited videos online at no cost.
