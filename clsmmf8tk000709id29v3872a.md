## 1. Imgur

As one of the most popular free image hosts, [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) is a top choice for quickly sharing images online. 

With Imgur, you don't even need an account. You can upload images up to 50MB anonymously. Registered users get higher file size limits up to 200MB per image.

Imgur compresses images to save bandwidth but retains image quality nicely. You also get handy editing tools to crop, rotate, add text and more.

## 2. Flickr

[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) has long been a favorite for storing photos online. The Yahoo-owned service offers a whopping 1TB of storage for free users.

You do need a Yahoo account to use Flickr. But with the huge free storage space, generous 200MB max file size per photo, and active community, it’s worth signing up.

Flickr’s interface makes it easy to organize your photo library with tags and albums. You can also apply filters and effects using Flickr’s basic but solid editing options.

## 3. TinyPic

[TinyPic](https://tinypic.com/) has been around since 2004 and remains a reliable image host today. 

Anonymous users can upload pics up to 32MB in size. But signing up for a free account lets you share images up to a generous 2GB each.

TinyPic gives you 25GB of bandwidth per month. Images get compressed to save space, but it optimizes photos nicely. Direct image links also make TinyPic pics easy to share on forums and social media.

## 4. PostImage

[PostImage](https://postimage.org/) offers one of the simplest free image sharing experiences. No registration is required.

You get 25GB of bandwidth monthly to use. Images are capped at 32MB for anonymous posting, which works for most standard images and screenshots.

PostImage doesn’t offer any frills like editing tools. But the website is ad-free and extremely easy to use for quick image sharing.

## 5. Photobucket

[Photobucket](https://photobucket.com/) offers both free and paid plans for image hosting. The free package gives you 2GB of storage and 1GB of bandwidth monthly.

Individual files can be up to 500MB each, which is higher than many competitors. Photobucket also has handy editing features like adding text, filters, overlays, and stickers.

The main limitation with the free plan is the lower bandwidth allocation. But Photobucket works great for hosting personal photo galleries and graphic assets.

## 6. DeviantArt

While [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/) is primarily an artwork sharing community, it also works for hosting photos.

You get 10GB of max file size for free. DeviantArt compresses images while retaining quality. Unique social features make it easy to share your work and get feedback from fellow photographers.

Just keep in mind DeviantArt has strict guidelines against posting purely commercial photography galleries. So it's best suited for hobbyists rather than professional photographers.

## 7. ImageShack 

[ImageShack](https://imageshack.us/) has gone through some ups and downs over the years. But the image host still offers a decent free plan with 5GB of bandwidth and 1GB of storage each month.

You do need to register for a free account. The max file size is capped at 1MB for anonymous uploads, so signing up gives you more space. Individual files can be up to 5GB for registered users.

ImageShack shows ads on free accounts. But the service integrates smoothly into forums and web apps using direct image links and BBCode.

## 8. ImgBB

For super simple image sharing, [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) is a top option. It doesn’t even require registration or logging in.

Just visit the website, select your images up to 16MB each in size, and copy the shareable links. ImgBB also lets you delete images at any time.

Since it's anonymous, ImgBB works best for temporary sharing or as an easy image host for forums. But power users may want more features offered by other services above.
