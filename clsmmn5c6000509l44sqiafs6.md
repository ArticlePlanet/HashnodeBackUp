Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) frameworks provide developers with pre-designed components and tools to quickly build web interfaces without having to write CSS from scratch. The right framework can speed up front-end development work significantly. 

In 2024, CSS frameworks continue to evolve with new features and improvements. Developers have many options to consider based on their specific needs. Here we review the top 10 CSS frameworks that are most popular, capable, and useful for developers this year.

## 1. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has exploded in popularity over the past few years due to its utility-first approach. Instead of predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes to construct fully custom user interfaces. 

For example, you can build a button with classes like `px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold rounded` instead of having a `.btn` class. This gives you flexibility while eliminating the need to write custom CSS.

Key features of Tailwind include:

- Highly customizable – Tailwind is customizable down to the color palette and default spacing/sizing values.

- Mobile-first workflows – Classes adapt for mobile/desktop breakpoints. 

- Just-in-time engine – Only generates the CSS you need for your final project.

- Extensive documentation – Thorough docs with examples make learning Tailwind easy.

- Active ecosystem – Many 3rd party plugins and tools integrate with Tailwind.

- Popular adoption – Used by large tech companies like GitHub, Shopify, Atlassian.

Tailwind requires learning many classes, but it enables rapid development after the learning curve. It’s a great choice if you value customization and want to break away from component libraries.

## 2. Bootstrap

Bootstrap by Twitter has been the most popular CSS framework for years. It provides a library of responsive, mobile-first components like buttons, menus, forms, and modal windows. 

Bootstrap uses a 12-column responsive grid system that adapts to phone, tablet, and desktop viewports. The full version bundles optional JavaScript behaviors for interactivity.

Key Bootstrap features:

- Huge component library – Tons of built-in components for common UI elements.

- Extensive theming – Change color schemes and CSS variables.

- Modular – Use parts in isolation like the grid or reboot CSS. 

- Sass versions – Customizable with Sass variables and mixins.

- Trusted by millions – Large community provides examples and support.

- Regular updates – Bootstrap 5 released in 2021 with new components and features.

If you want a batteries-included framework with almost everything you need for web and mobile apps, Bootstrap is a leading choice trusted by enterprises and startups worldwide.

## 3. Bulma 

Bulma is a popular open source CSS framework known for its modularity. It provides ready-made interface elements while allowing extensive customization.

Bulma uses Flexbox for its layout system and comes with a responsive, mobile-first grid. But it avoids prescriptive CSS styles, leaving styling details up to you.

Why developers love Bulma:

If you want a lightweight starter kit focused on layout and structural elements, Bulma lets you retain control over styling details.

## 4. Materialize

Materialize is an open source CSS framework based on Google's Material Design principles. It aims to adapt Material Design components for the web using standard frontend technologies.

Materialize provides many material UI elements like cards, buttons, parallax, shadows, side navs, and more. The grid is similar to Bootstrap but uses CSS classes instead of grid tiers.

If you want material styling without the complexity of something like Angular Material, give Materialize CSS a try. The library is focused purely on presentation.

## 5. Foundation

Foundation by Zurb is another major responsive CSS framework supporting both sites and apps. It contains reusable components optimized for mobile, web, and desktop.

In addition to CSS, Foundation provides flexible JavaScript widgets and templates. The XY grid distinguishes it from Bootstrap with the ability to mix column widths.

## 8. Pure CSS

Pure CSS is a lightweight set of CSS modules for layout, menus, buttons, forms, tables, etc. The goal is to provide a starting point for your CSS without enforcing styles.

Classes use a `pure-` prefix like `.pure-menu-horizontal` and `.pure-button-primary` for clarity. You can override any styles by writing CSS without specificity issues.

Benefits of using Pure CSS:

- Ultra lightweight – under 5kb minified.

- Modular – Include only the CSS you need.

## 9. Skeleton 

Skeleton is a tiny, responsive boilerplate that provides basic UI elements without dictating visual styles. It's ideal for rapidly building responsive prototypes and sites.

The grid uses a syntax like `<div class="container"> <div class="six columns">...</div> </div>` for responsive columns. You style components like buttons and forms from scratch.

Notable features of Skeleton:

For example, Tachyons classes like `f5` `ba` `b--blue` `bg-light-gray` can style an element with font size, border style, color, and background. You combine classes to create any component style needed.

Reasons to use Tachyons:
